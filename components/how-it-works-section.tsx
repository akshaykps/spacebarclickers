        How Spacebar Clicker Works

                The core concept of Spacebar Clicker is elegantly simple: press
                your spacebar (or click the main game area) as rapidly as you
                can! Each press registers as a "click," contributing to your
                ever-growing total score. The faster and more consistently you
                click, the quicker your score accumulates. It's a pure test of
                your finger speed and endurance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Keep an eye on the main counter â€“ it's your real-time display of
                progress. You'll also notice small floating numbers appearing
                with each click, visually confirming your score increments and
                adding a dynamic feel to your efforts.

              <p>
                Spacebar Clicker features a comprehensive achievement system
                with unique milestones, each representing a significant "stage"
                in your clicking journey. These aren't just badges; they're
                powerful upgrades!
              </p>
              <p>
                As your total clicks reach specific thresholds, you'll
                automatically unlock new achievements. Once unlocked, you can
                choose to "activate" them from the Achievements panel.
                Activating an achievement grants you permanent bonuses,
                fundamentally changing your gameplay:

                  even when you're not actively pressing the spacebar.

                  Some rare achievements even transform the visual theme of your
                  game, offering a fresh aesthetic experience!
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Achievements are categorized by rarity (Common, Rare, Epic,
                Legendary, Mythic), with rarer achievements offering more
                substantial bonuses and requiring higher click counts to unlock.
                Strategically activating your achievements is key to maximizing
                your score!

              <p>
                Your "Clicks/sec" (CPS) is a dynamic metric, calculated every
                second based on your recent clicking activity. It gives you an
                immediate sense of your current performance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond your raw speed, the game rewards rapid, continuous
                clicking with a "click streak." If you click fast enough, a
                streak bonus activates, temporarily multiplying the value of
                each click. Maintain your streak to keep the bonus active and
                watch your score skyrocket!
              </p>
              <p>
                Activated achievements play a crucial role here. They provide a
                base click multiplier that permanently increases the value of
                every click. Additionally, many achievements come with passive
                auto-clickers, which generate clicks for you automatically,
                adding to your total score and CPS without any manual effort.
                The combination of manual clicks, streak bonuses, and activated
                auto-clickers creates a powerful synergy for exponential score
                growth.
